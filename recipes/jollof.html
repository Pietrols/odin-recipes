        Description
       </h3>
       <p>
        Jollof is a very popular Nigerian cuisine, and with good reason. With variations served in almost ever home and street corner. It combines a blend of long-grain rice, tomatoes, chilies, onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions, the unmistakable aroma and exquisite taste make it a universal favorite.
